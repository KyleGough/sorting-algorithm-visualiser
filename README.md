# sorting-algorithm-visualiser
Sorting Algorithm Visualiser created using C# as a windows form application. Supports 20 sorting algorithms and 18 types of start data. Option to compare two algorithms simultaneously and customisability available to change size of the datasets, range of numbers in the dataset and delay. Served as a learning tool for understanding different algorithms and their applications. 

Feature Overview:

  Real-Time and Pausable Visualiser
  20 Sorting Algorithms (incl. Bubble, Quick, Merge, Insertion...).
  18 Starting Datasets (incl. Random, Reversed, Almost Sorted, Sinusoidal...).
  Compare Two Algorithms Simultaneously.
  Customisable Dataset Size, Range and Delay.
  Provides Statistics for each Algorithm.
  Custom Colours and Data Display Styles.

Sorting Algorithms:

  Bitonic - Parallel sorting algorithm.
  Bogo - Randomly permutates elements.
  Bubble - Common simple algorithm.
  Cocktail - Bubble sort in both directions.
  Comb - Bubble sort variant with reducing gap.
  Cycle - Optimal array writes.
  Gnome - Insertion sort but swaps until element in correct position.
  Heap - Builds heap and extracts from unsorted region.
  Insertion - Builds sorted array one element at a time.
  JSort - Builds heap then uses insertion sort.
  Merge - Recursively merges half of the array.
  OddEven - Compares all odd/even pairs then vice-versa.
  Pancake - Flips array between regions.
  Permutation - Compares every permutation of the array.
  Radix LSD - Analyses least significant digits.
  Selection - Builds sorted array one element at a time.
  Shell - Bubble sort variant with reducing gap.
  Smooth - Builds heap then extracts largest element.
  Stooge - Highly inefficient, recursively sorts first 2/3 then last 2/3.
  Quick - Recursively uses a pivot.
