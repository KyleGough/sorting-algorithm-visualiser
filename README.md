# sorting-algorithm-visualiser
Sorting algorithm visualiser that can compare two algorithms simultaneously from a list of 20 sorting algorithms (incl. Bubble, Quick, Merge, Insertion...) and 18 starting datasets. Provides ability to increase delay, change dataset size and range. Customisability for display mode and colours. Displays statistics for each algorithm. Written in C#.

Feature Overview:

  Real-Time and Pausable Visualiser
  20 Sorting Algorithms (incl. Bubble, Quick, Merge, Insertion...)
  18 Starting Datasets (incl. Random, Reversed, Almost Sorted, Sinusoidal...)
  Compare Two Algorithms Simultaneously
  Customisable Dataset Size, Range and Delay
  Provides Statistics for each Algorithm
  Custom Colours and Data Display Styles

Sorting Algorithms:

  Bitonic - Parallel sorting algorithm
  Bogo - Randomly permutates elements
  Bubble - Common simple algorithm
  Cocktail - Bubble sort in both directions
  Comb - Bubble sort variant with reducing gap
  Cycle - Optimal array writes
  Gnome - Insertion sort but swaps until element in correct position
  Heap - Builds heap and extracts from unsorted region
  Insertion - Builds sorted array one element at a time
  JSort - Builds heap then uses insertion sort
  Merge - Recursively merges half of the array
  OddEven - Compares all odd/even pairs then vice-versa
  Pancake - Flips array between regions
  Permutation - Compares every permutation of the array
  Radix LSD - Analyses least significant digits
  Selection - Builds sorted array one element at a time
  Shell - Bubble sort variant with reducing gap
  Smooth - Builds heap then extracts largest element
  Stooge - Highly inefficient, recursively sorts first 2/3 then last 2/3
  Quick - Recursively uses a pivot
  
Start Data: 

  Random, Linear, Reversed, Almost Reversed, Sorted, Almost Sorted, Few Unique, Sinusoidal, Sawtooth, Reverse Sawtooth, Cycloid,   Normal Distribution, Structured, Uniform, Triangular, Function 1, Function 2, Function 3
